# Fuzz

Fuzz 3.0 is a HTML/Sass-CSS framework of principles, designed for fast implementation of custom, responsive grid-based websites.

The framework separates presentational concerns into different hierarchical layers. This simplifies the role of each layer and allows a greater proportion of the codebase to be modular and rapidly reusable.
